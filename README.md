# 🐍 AI Snake Game

AI Snake Game is a browser-based implementation of the classic Snake game with both manual and AI-controlled gameplay. In manual mode, the player controls the snake using keyboard arrow keys, while in AI mode, the snake navigates autonomously using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) pathfinding algorithm to reach food while avoiding walls and self-collisions.

The game is built using HTML5 Canvas for rendering, CSS for styling, and modern JavaScript (ES6 modules) for logic. The project follows a modular architecture, separating game logic, AI logic, and utilities into clean, reusable components. A real-time game loop handles movement, rendering, collision detection, and score updates, ensuring smooth gameplay.

This project demonstrates practical application of data structures and algorithms, real-time simulations, and frontend engineering best practices. It is designed as a strong GitHub portfolio project suitable for showcasing problem-solving skills, algorithm implementation, and clean code organization.
